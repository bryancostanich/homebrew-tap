  # Homebrew invokes this after installing/linking the new keg. Never restart
  # from install itself: a download/unpack/install failure must leave the old

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Start the terminal client with cercano-cli.
      A successful upgrade restarts an existing agent after draining work.
      An absent agent is not started by installation or upgrade.
      If post-install restart fails, inspect the reported error and agent logs.
      Retry with: #{bin}/cercano restart-after-upgrade
      Manual restart from an attached client: /restart-agent
